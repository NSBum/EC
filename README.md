![Environment Canada](http://www.public-domain-photos.com/free-cliparts-1/flags/america/national_flag_of_canada_.png)

[Indigo](https://www.indigodomo.com) is a home automation software controller for the Mac supporting multiple interface technologies.

This plugin allows you to create weather station "devices" that can provide data to Indigo. For example, you can create a weather station for the nearest Environment Canada site and use its data to feed rules in Indigo.
