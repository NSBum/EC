Indigo 7 plugin for Environment Canada weather data

![Environment Canada](http://www.public-domain-photos.com/free-cliparts-1/flags/america/national_flag_of_canada_.png)

[Indigo](https://www.indigodomo.com) is a home automation software controller for the Mac supporting multiple interface technologies.

This plugin allows you to create weather station "devices" that can provide data to Indigo. For example, you can create a weather station for the nearest Environment Canada site and use its data to feed rules in Indigo.

Creating a new weather device is the same as for any new plugin device in Indigo. After creating the device, you will be presented with a configuration dialog for the device:

By clicking the button you can find a [list of all of the available weather station](http://dd.weather.gc.ca/citypage_weather/docs/site_list_towns_en.csv) identifiers in Canada. If you would prefer to search by province, you can [search here](http://dd.weather.gc.ca/citypage_weather/xml/) too. Sorry, there's not a cleaner way to do this yet.

That's all there is to it.
